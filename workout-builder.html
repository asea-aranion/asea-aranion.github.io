                With Workout Builder, you can create and customize your own exercise routines, 
                track any weights you use, 
                and see how far you've come by viewing your workout history.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can customize your routines in Workout Builder down to the second. 
                After adding your moves and rest periods to a block, you can set the block to repeat up to 10 times.
                You can even add to or subtract from a move or rest's duration or rep count on each repetition!
                Custom colors let you find your look in every area of the app.
            </p>

                Workout Builder is mainly built on SwiftUI. 
                It's designed with responsiveness and accessibility in mind, supporting Dynamic Type and VoiceOver.
            </p>
            <p>All of your workout data is persisted across app launches with SwiftData. 
                Objects representing your created workouts and history are stored and updated in your device's storage while you use the app.
                Then, the next time you view your list of workouts or the weights you've used on a certain move, they can be queried, sorted, displayed, and edited once again.
